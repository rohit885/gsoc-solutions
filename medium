#creating the 100 dimensional hypercube and then sampling point from it for 2 diffrent walk steps

library("volesti")
P=GenCube(100,'H')
p=sample_points(P,walk_step = 10)
plot(p)
q=sample_points(P,walk_step = 20)
plot(q)
r=samole points(P,walk_step=25)
plot(r)


#pictures of the sampled items are in the readme file

mixing of occurs more towards the the line y=x 
which pases through the origin and while sampling more points of the sample are present near the line rather than the aeay from the line
we can see images for more clarification
